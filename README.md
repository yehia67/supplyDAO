# ChakraUI CSS + TypeScript + Next.js Starter

This is a lightweight starterkit / boilerplate to get up and running with ChakraUI CSS, TypeScript and Next.js.

## Why make this boilerplate?

ChakraUI, Next.js, and TypeScript is an excellent stack for building web apps. The most annoying part of using the stack
is setting it up every time, so I made an easy to use template that I and many others can use.

## Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### 2. Run Development Environment

```bash
yarn dev # npm run dev
```

### Test Production Environment

I also included a `stage` script that will build and start a production server. You can run it with:

```bash
yarn stage # npm run stage
```

Alternatively you can run:

```bash
yarn build # npm run build
yarn start # npm start
```
